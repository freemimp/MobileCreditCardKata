# Instructions

### 1. Setup
 There is no setup for this project, but you should be able to pull all dependencies.


### 1. App description

- This app is mobile version of Credit card validation Kata.
- It shows basic credit card UI, that changes icon depending on card number typed in - Story 2, 
  it shows default placeholder warning icon for empty number or unknown card number
- Two use cases detect, verify and return card type - Story 1, that is used in UI to display card type icon.
- Unit tests are added for all logic, but no ui tests/snapshot created as this would require more time.
- I used jetpack compose, hilt, Junit5, Mockk.
- This code is WIP.
